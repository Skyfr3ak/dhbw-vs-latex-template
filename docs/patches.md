Since the formatting specifications for text work at the DHBW-VS are [changed regularly](https://github.com/skyfrk/dhbw-vs-latex-template/issues/42), so that no template can be created which could relieve students of the scientific work, a few manual adjustments are necessary for the different academic years.

âš  This template is based on the 2017 guidelines (2015 study regulations & Mrs. Heinrichs specifications). Required adjustments for compliance with newer specifications are documented here.

## Required adjustments for 2018 students

The 2018 page margins differ from earlier versions. 2018 students have to manually add the code below to their preamble.

```tex
% preamble

\geometry{%
    a4paper,
    tmargin = {4cm},
    bmargin = {2cm},
    lmargin = {4cm},
    rmargin = {2cm}
}
```

## Required adjustments for 2019 students

The specifications for 2019 students are not yet available.

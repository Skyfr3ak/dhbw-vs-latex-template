# Patches

Since the formatting specifications for text work at the DHBW-VS are changed regularly, so that no template can be created which could relieve students of the scientific work, a few manual adjustments are necessary for the different academic years.

:warning: This template always tries to satisfy the latest requirements. Required adjustments for compliance with older specifications are documented here.

## Required adjustments for 2017 students

The 2017 page margins differ from later versions. 2017 students have to manually add the code below to their preamble.

```tex
% preamble

\geometry{%
    a4paper,
    tmargin = {2.5cm},
    bmargin = {2cm},
    lmargin = {4cm},
    rmargin = {1.5cm}
}
```

## Required adjustments for 2018 students

None so far.

## Required adjustments for 2019 students

The specifications for 2019 students are not yet available.

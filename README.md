# DHBW-VS academic text LaTeX template

This is a LaTeX template for academic text assignments at the [DBHW-VS](https://www.dhbw-vs.de/), especially for business computer science students created along [the specifications](template/dhbw-text-requirements.md) written by Mrs. Heinrich. Using this template **speeds up the writing process** as you only have **focus on writing actual content**. All weird formatting requirements are met automatically! :beer::sunglasses::v:
